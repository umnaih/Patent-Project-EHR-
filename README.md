# Electronic Health Record (EHR) System

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Electronic Health Record (EHR) System project which was prepared for the SEN2001 programming languages course/2021. This project was conceived to address real-world challenges faced by healthcare professionals and patients, with a focus on improving the quality of healthcare services and enhancing patient comfort.

## Project Inspiration and Steps

- **Step 1 - Project Inception:**
   - The project was inspired by the difficulties faced by healthcare workers, including my sibling, who shared her work-related challenges.
   - The initial phase involved brainstorming project ideas and defining key features.

- **Step 2 - Literature Review:**
   - A comprehensive literature review was conducted to gain insights from existing healthcare systems and solutions.

- **Step 3 - Interface Design:**
   - The project included designing interfaces for both a mobile application and software using HTML and CSS. You can view some of these interfaces in [References]

- **Step 4 - Flowchart Development:**
   - Detailed flowcharts were created to visualize the processes and functionalities of the system.

- **Step 5 - Materials and Methods:**
   - The project's materials and methods were meticulously documented, outlining the technical aspects of implementation.

- **Step 6 - Discussion and Results:**
   - The discussion and results section highlights the project's objectives and outcomes, emphasizing improvements in healthcare services and patient well-being.

## Abstract

Our project centers around the development of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) Software, designed to connect patients and healthcare organizations. It comprises two main components: a software application for pharmacies and a mobile application for patients.

### Benefits and Problem Solving

The project aims to address several challenges encountered by pharmacists and patients, including:
- Patients forgetting medicine names and dosages.
- Incomplete or misleading patient information.
- Lack of awareness about medication allergies.
- Time-consuming data collection processes.

### Software Application for Pharmacies

The pharmacy software offers:
- Quick access to patient information.
- Efficient medication management.
- Streamlined patient registration.
- Access to a comprehensive patient database.

### Mobile Application for Patients

The patient mobile application provides:
- Medication reminders.
- Medicine information, including side effects and remaining pills.
- A journal to track medication effects.
- First aid information.

## Key Features

**For Pharmacists:**
- Quick access to patient information.
- Efficient medication management.
- Seamless patient registration.
- Access to a comprehensive patient database.

**For Patients:**
- Medication reminders.
- Medicine information and side effects.
- Medicine purchase history.
- Allergy information.
- First aid guidance.

## Potential Applications

The project's benefits extend beyond pharmacies and patients:
- Integration with hospital records for emergency care.
- Integration with laboratory information systems for streamlined testing.
- Empowering physician-patient cooperation by providing comprehensive health information.

## Limitations

Despite its advantages, the project has some limitations, including high initial costs, training requirements, and data security concerns. Ongoing efforts are needed to address these challenges.

## Future Improvements

Future enhancements could include demographic analysis for medication effectiveness, integration with national health systems, and additional health-related features.

## Conclusion

The EHR system presented in this repository has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing a unified database of patient information. It aims to improve medical services, reduce errors, and enhance patient well-being.
